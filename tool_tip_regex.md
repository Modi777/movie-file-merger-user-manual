## Tool Tip Regex
The Tool Tip Regex area is there to search in the tool tips, which pop up when you hover with the mouse over a list entry.  To search a list simply take an entry of the list you want to search and drop it on the regular expression.  All entries matching the regular expression will be selected in the list.

Regular expressions can be very complicated, but basic regular expressions are not that complicated and it should be possible to figure out how they work by looking at the examples. Regular expressions can be tested on the [Rubular website](http://rubular.com).

Some examples are listed in the drop down list to the right of the entry field.
