## Supporting Programs Paths Settings
MFM uses just 2 programs which are called direct; TeraCopy and Media info.  Other programs, like the web browser and the media player, are launched by executing the file or http address.

Note that even when the German version of Windows 7 is installed and the “Program Files” folder is called “Programme” in the Windows explorer the paths work also with “Program Files”.  That means if the default settings are used during the installation there should be no need the change these settings.

### TeraCopy Path
