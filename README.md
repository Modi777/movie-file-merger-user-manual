# Movie File Merger User Manual

Movie File Merger helps you with the selective combination of video collections, like home videos, movies, series, or documentaries. It can be used also for other types of collections, like music, or basically any files, but MFM is optimized for videos. MFM is portable, so that you can run it from anywhere, on any hard disk or memory stick, or even in Dropbox, which makes it easier to share lists with other people. MFM works together with multiple other programs, like FileBot, GOM, VLC, or TeraCopy. All of them can be downloaded and used for free.

You can download the Movie File Merger and supporting programs from the [MFM website](http://movie-file-merger.org).

## Hidden Benefits

MFM is designed so that it is quite flexible. How and for what to use it depends basically on you, what means also that you'll have to use it for some time to figure out which way is best for you. Some of the not that obvious benefits are:

- Back up your video collections on hard disks of family members, that way they can watch your videos and you safe space
- Social gathering when visiting your friend, because your two hard disks have to be brought together to make it happen
- Save internet bandwidth, because large data quantities are moved over USB or similar
- Faster than backing up in the cloud, transferring data over USB 3.0 is around 150MB/s
