# Movie File Merger User Manual

Movie File Merger helps you with the selective combination of video collections, like home videos, movies, series, or documentaries. It can be used also for other types of collections, like music, or basically any files, but MFM is optimized for videos. MFM runs in Dropbox, which makes it easier to share lists with other people. MFM is portable, so that you can run it from anywhere, on any hard disk or memory stick. MFM works together with multiple other programs, like GOM, VLC, MediaInfo, or TeraCopy. All of them can be downloaded and used for free.

You can download the Movie File Merger from the [MFM website](http://modi777.github.io/Movie-File-Merger/).

## Features

MFM is not a movie database program like Personal Video Database! MFM is designed so that the lists can be easily updated once out of date. Some examples of what you can do with MFM are:

- Select which videos are copied or moved
- Select the videos to copy before hand; lists are small can be easily distributed over the internet
- Copy only relevant videos in the Wish list
- Ignore videos in the Existing and Garbage lists; don't have all the stuff duplicated in various locations
- Select movies according to predefined genre lists from IMDb
- Select videos according to regular expressions which can be tested with Rubular; for example year 2013
- Search for movies or series on IMDb
- Search for videos on torrentz.eu
- List detailed media information with MediaInfo
- View video media information in the pop-ups when hovering over a list entry
- Select videos according to filtered media information; for example horizontal resolution greater than 1000 pixels
- Start play the video with your default player

## Hidden Benefits

MFM is designed so that it is quite flexible. How and for what to use it depends basically on you, what means also that you'll have to use it for some time to figure out which way is best for you. Some of the not that obvious benefits are:

- Back up your video collections on hard disks of family members, that way they can watch your videos and you safe space
- Social gathering when visiting your friend, because your two hard disks have to be brought together to make it happen
- Save internet bandwidth, because large data quantities are moved over USB or similar
- Faster than backing up in the cloud, transferring data over USB 3.0 is around 150MB/s
