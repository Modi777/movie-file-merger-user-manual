## :open_file_folder: Manuals Folder :open_file_folder:

The Manuals folder actually only contains the screenshots for the manuals in the Wiki and the GitBook [Movie File Merger User Manual](http://modi777.gitbooks.io/movie-file-merger-user-manual/).  The screenshots will remain in the Manuals folder until it is probably renamed to Screenshots folder or something similar.  :smirk:

:construction: AT the moment there are some problems publishing the GitBook Movie File Merger User Manual :construction:
