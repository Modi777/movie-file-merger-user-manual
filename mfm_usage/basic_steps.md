## Basic Steps
Create a list of your existing items, by adding all top level folders of one collection type on all your hard disks to the Existing list.  Save the Existing list, by switching to another collection type.  Use Save List As... to export the list for later processing or as a backup.

Get an Import folder or a list from Dropbox, so that you can see which items you have and which garbage are.  Erase the existing and garbage items from the Import list, so that only new items and wish items are left in the Import list.

Mark the new items as Garbage if you donâ€™t want to have them or as Wish to process them if they should be copied or moved to the Target folder.  Save the Garbage and the Wish lists.

To process your items, select if you want to copy or move the items to process from the Import folder.  Check Keep Folders if the folder structure in the Import folder should be kept.  To flatten the folder structure, uncheck Keep Folders.  Click on the progress bar to process the items.  Wait until the processing is finished.
Repeat the procedure until no new items are left in the Import list.
