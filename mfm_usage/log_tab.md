# Log Tab

The Log tab shows basic information about what has been done during this session. After a Just Scan It run has been performed it shows also duplicated videos.

You can use the log to find duplicated videos.  Once you performed Just Scan It 2 times, duplicated videos will be listed under both locations.

Click on the manual pictures to open the online manuals or on the banner to go to the Movie File Merger web page.

If you want to save the log you can select the text, copy it to the clip board and past it into a rich text file, or for example MS Word.
