## Process the Import

The process Import section allows you to copy or move the actual video and subtitle files.  You have to install TeraCopy to do the actual processing.  See the Installation section how to setup TeraCopy so that it does not replace the default Windows copy or move.

### Copy
If Copy is selected and you click the Progress Bar, the Wish colored items in the Import list will be copied to the Target folder.  Actually, MFM does not do the copying, but just prepares a list which it hands over to TeraCopy.  As soon as MFM has handed over the list, you can continue selecting the items you want to process next.  You can start the next copy process even if TeraCopy is still running.  New items will be added the TeraCopy waiting list and processed when the time has come.

### Move
If Move is checked and the Progress Bar clicked, the Wish colored items in the Import list will be moved to the Target folder.  Actually, MFM does not do the moving, but just prepares a list which it hands over to TeraCopy.  As soon as MFM has handed over the list, you can continue selecting the items you want to process next.  You can start the next moving process even if TeraCopy is still running.  New items will be added the TeraCopy waiting list and processed when the time has come.

### Keep Folders
If Keep Folders is checked the folder structure of the Import folder will be recreated in the Target folder.  Only folders which contain items that are copied or moved are created.  To keep the keep the folder structure is especially useful for series.  For movies I would recommend to flatten the folder structure.

### Progress Bar
Click the progress bar to start the processing.  MFM will create list files and hand them over to TeraCopy, which does the actual copying or moving.  As soon as MFM has handed over the list, you can continue selecting the items you want to process next.
