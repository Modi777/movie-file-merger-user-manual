# MFM Settings

The Settings tab contains all settings to adjust MFM to the style of your collection. Anyway, if you follow my style, then there should not be too much need to change any of the settings.

Most of the settings are regular expressions.  See the chapter Regular Expressions at the end of MFM Settings for more information.
