## Share Rings

You can open share rings with your friends, to distribute videos.  A share ring is a group of people, who live in same area, can meet each other, and have a video collection on their hard disk or disks.  Each member of a share ring scans its own videos with MFM and distributes the lists in the MFM Collection folder in Dropbox.  Other members can then preselect the videos they want to copy at home and put them into their Wish lists.  Once the hard disks are brought together, MFM extracts only the wanted videos from your friend’s hard disk.

The MFM Collection folder is used as default from MFM.  If you want to open another share ring with a different group of people just make another folder and put your lists in there.  There is no limitation concerning the amount of collection folders you can have.  One member of the share ring will be the owner of the shared folder in Dropbox, with the right to exclude people if needed.  As default from Dropbox every member can invite other people.  However, the owner of the Dropbox folder can disable that option.

Since all members of a share ring compare their list with each other it is quite important to use the same naming conventions and item unification settings.

Since it is a lot of work to select videos, precompiled lists (with thousands of entries) can be downloaded from IMDb.  The precompiled lists can be for genres, like sci-fi, romance, drama action...  If you put a precompiled list in your wish folder MFM searches for videos of all genres in the wish list.  Some precompiled lists are also provided with the MFM installation.

## MFM & Dropbox

MFM is designed to be executed as a whole in Dropbox.  Use Dropbox to share your lists with your friends.  Dropbox is best used to the right side of MFM in the Windows Explorer.  Basically there are three folders in Dropbox, which are relevant for MFM...

MFM Program – Contains files need for the execution of MFM.  To start MFM double click on Movie File Merger.exe.  Create a shortcut on your desktop of easy access of MFM.

MFM Private – Contains your private copy of the initialization file and your collections, which are loaded be default from MFM.  The first time your start MFM it will create this folder at the same level of the MFM Program folder.  It contains also the TeraCopy Lists folder, where MFM stores the lists, which have been previously processed.

MFM Collection – Contains the collections for sharing and is the standard folder for MFM.  Export and import lists here to share with your friends.  You can make as many independent collections folders as you want and share with different groups of friends.

To manage your Dropbox, click on the Dropbox item in the Windows System Tray and select Dropbox.com.  You can then invite other people to your collection folder.

Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop folders or list files into MFM.  I would recommend you to place Windows Explorer to the right of MFM.  To place a window so that it occupies half of the screen, drag it on the title bar to the very right or left side of the screen.

MFM uses just a few percent of the free Dropbox online storage, so that you can use Dropbox also for other things, like sharing your photos with your friends, which is much, much easier over Dropbox then over e-mail. Note also that every time you recommend a new user for Dropbox your and their free on-line storage will be increased by 500 MB to a maximum of 16 GB.  All you need is the e-mail of your friend, for which Dropbox should be registered.
