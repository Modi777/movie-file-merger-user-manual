## Share Rings

You can open share rings with your friends, to distribute videos.  A share ring is a group of people, who live in same area, can meet each other, and have a video collection on their hard disk or disks.  Each member of a share ring scans its own videos with MFM and distributes the lists in the MFM Collection folder in Dropbox.  Other members can then preselect the videos they want to copy at home and put them into their Wish lists.  Once the hard disks are brought together, MFM extracts only the wanted videos from your friendâ€™s hard disk.

The MFM Collection folder is used as default from MFM.  If you want to open another share ring with a different group of people just make another folder and put your lists in there.  There is no limitation concerning the amount of collection folders you can have.  One member of the share ring will be the owner of the shared folder in Dropbox, with the right to exclude people if needed.  As default from Dropbox every member can invite other people.  However, the owner of the Dropbox folder can disable that option.

Since all members of a share ring compare their list with each other it is quite important to use the same naming conventions and item unification settings.

Since it is a lot of work to select videos, precompiled lists (with thousands of entries) can be downloaded from IMDb.  The precompiled lists can be for genres, like sci-fi, romance, drama action...  If you put a precompiled list in your wish folder MFM searches for videos of all genres in the wish list.  Some precompiled lists are also provided with the MFM installation.
