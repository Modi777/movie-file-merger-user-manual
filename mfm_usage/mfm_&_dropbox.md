## MFM & Dropbox
More information about Dropbox can be found on the [Dropbox website](https://www.dropbox.com).
> "One place for all your stuff, wherever you are."  Dropbox is a home for all your photos, docs, videos, and files.  Anything you add to Dropbox will automatically show up on all your computers, phones and even the Dropbox website — so you can access your stuff from anywhere.  Dropbox also makes it super easy to share with others, whether you're a student or professional, parent or grandparent.  Even if you accidentally spill a latte on your laptop, have no fear!  Relax knowing that your stuff is safe in Dropbox and will never be lost.

MFM is designed to be executed as a whole in Dropbox.  Use Dropbox to share your lists with your friends.  Dropbox is best used to the right side of MFM in the Windows Explorer.  Basically there are three folders in Dropbox, which are relevant for MFM...

MFM Program – Contains files need for the execution of MFM.  To start MFM double click on Movie File Merger.exe.  Create a shortcut on your desktop of easy access of MFM.

MFM Private – Contains your private copy of the initialization file and your collections, which are loaded be default from MFM.  The first time your start MFM it will create this folder at the same level of the MFM Program folder.  It contains also the TeraCopy Lists folder, where MFM stores the lists, which have been previously processed.

MFM Collection – Contains the collections for sharing and is the standard folder for MFM.  Export and import lists here to share with your friends.  You can make as many independent collections folders as you want and share with different groups of friends.

To manage your Dropbox, click on the Dropbox item in the Windows System Tray and select Dropbox.com.  You can then invite other people to your collection folder.

Use Windows Explorer to drag and drop folders or list files into MFM.  I would recommend you to place Windows Explorer to the right of MFM.  To place a window so that it occupies half of the screen, drag it on the title bar to the very right or left side of the screen.

MFM uses just a few percent of the free Dropbox online storage, so that you can use Dropbox also for other things, like sharing your photos with your friends, which is much, much easier over Dropbox then over e-mail. Note also that every time you recommend a new user for Dropbox your and their free on-line storage will be increased by 500 MB to a maximum of 16 GB.  All you need is the e-mail of your friend, for which Dropbox should be registered.
