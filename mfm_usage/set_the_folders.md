## Set the Folders

There are two folders, which are relevant for the processing of files, the Target and the Import folder.  When you click the progress bar the files which match the Wish items in the Import list are copied or moved from the Import folder to the Target folder.

### Target Folder
The Target folder is the folder where you want to copy or move your wish movies to.  Drop a folder from the Windows Explorer into the text field beside the Target folder icon.

If items are found in the Target folder they are added to the Existing list.  It is recommended to make a folder structure in your target folder similar to the collection types you are processing.  For example you could have a Movies, a Documentaries, and a Series folder in the Target folder.

### Import Folder
The import folder is set automatically when you drop a folder or file in the Import list.  If a file or multiple folders are dropped in the Import list the according top level folder is used.  If you drop a folder in the text field to the left of the Import icon the import list is automatically populated.
