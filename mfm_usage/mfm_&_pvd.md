## MFM and PVD

You can find more information about PVD on http://www.videodb.info/forum_en.  With Personal Video Database you can catalogue your movie collection fast and easy. Thought-out user interface and different database management function make it easy to create and manage big movie databases. Powerful filtering, grouping and sorting help you find movies very fast.

Use Personal Video Database to generate lists of movies according to certain filter criteria or to rename movies to their standard names.  It is important that movies have good names, preferably from IMDb.

With advanced filter you can setup complex criteria, and then export the list.  Clean up the exported list, with a text editor like Notepad++, so that only the movie names are in the list, and then drop it into MFM.
